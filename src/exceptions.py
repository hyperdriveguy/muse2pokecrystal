"""
This module contains the custom exceptions for Muse2pokecrystal.

Why use custom exceptions at all?
1) So we can distinguish actual bugs from user error a little better.
2) Allow for more graceful exits.

Exceptions are only used for showstopper errors that output garbage.
Warnings are printed using print().

This module is a part of Muse2pokecrystal.
